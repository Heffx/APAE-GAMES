Thanks for purchasing this package.

=====================================
Here are some tips:
=====================================
1. Each window has proper background png, but you can use generic one (without curved edges), that is prepared for scale-9.
2. I recommend using proper "drop shadow" effect on texts (see previews of each window).
3. I recommend using font colors I picked for each text field/title/etc (see previews of each window).
4. Some text fields have enlarged letter spacing - it looks better this way (see previews of each window).
=====================================

If you have any questions or request for some additional graphic elements, do not hesitate to ask :).
